# restful-weather

## Goal

To build an API that enables accessing meteorological data in a way that is useful for humans and machines. 

## Initial assumptions

An OGC Web Coverage Service is, for lab purposes, the most straightforward way of accessing gridded weather data.

HATEOAS constrained REST is the best architecture for delivering a usable web service.
